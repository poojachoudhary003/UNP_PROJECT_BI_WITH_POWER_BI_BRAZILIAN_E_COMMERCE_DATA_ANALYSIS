# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA_ANALYSIS
I completed a Power BI project in collaboration with UNP focused on the Brazilian E-Commerce landscape to derive actionable business insights from complex datasets. The primary objective was to evaluate operational efficiency and customer behavior by analyzing key metrics such as a Total Revenue of 13.59M and an Average Review Score of 4.09. Through this analysis, I identified a heavy payment dependency on credit cards (78.34% of value) and significant revenue concentration in specific regions like São Paulo. Additionally, the project highlighted a critical decline in revenue during recent years and high late delivery percentages in states like Alagoas. To address these needs, I developed dashboards to track on-time delivery (currently at 92%) and suggested strategies to convert one-time buyers into loyal customers. This project serves as a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to optimize logistics, diversify payment methods, and implement growth strategies to reverse declining sales trends.
